# brick_editor

Project summary:<br>We are to implement a webpage using Microsoftâ€™s Monaco editor in typescript that utilizes drag-and-drop blocks.
The blocks will consist of coding areas such as if statements, functions, and loops. 
Certain parts of the code in the editor will be read-only and will result in an error if the user attempts to make changes.


We are planning to implement:
<ul>
  <li>Online Monaco editor
  <li>Blocks:<br>
  - Function declaration,<br>
  - Variable declartion,<br>
  - Variable assignment,<br>
  - If statement,<br>
  - If-Else statement,<br>
  - While loop,<br>
  - For loop,<br>
  - Function call,<br>
  - Method call,<br>
  - Array access,<br>
  - Array assignment<br>
  <li>Read-only parts of code
  <li>Error Messages
  <li>Search Function
  <li>Auto-complete
 <ul>
